Sports is one of the most popular topics in podcasts, and today Spotify doubled down on its podcast strategy with a big acquisition to grow its sports coverage: it announced that it is buying The Ringer, the popular network of podcasts created and run by broadcaster Bill Simmons, with 30 sports and other podcasts in its mix and some 100 million downloads per month. Spotify today has 700,000 podcasts in its catalog and earlier today noted that the business grew 200 percent in the last quarter. Terms of the deal are not being disclosed; however, when the deal between Spotify and The Ringer was first rumored last month , it was noted that the latter company was profitable and had revenues of $15 million in 2018. As a guide, Spotify last year spent what’s estimated to be between $400 million and $500 million acquiring other podcast assets. Putting aside the price, this is a huge deal for Spotify, picking up one of the premium and most popular brands in podcasting to boost what is already a fast-growing business for the company. But Spotify is using this acquisition not just to double down on sports content, but to make a much bigger move into how it believes not just audio but popular media overall is evolving. “The trend that we are investing in here is that radio is moving online,” CEO Daniel Ek said in the earnings call today, later adding: “We bought the next ESPN.” Of course, Simmons and his team also have a very strong following for shows that cover pop culture and more. But for now, sports are front and center in the company’s strategy.
