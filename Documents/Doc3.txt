Roblox announced today that it’s buying a digital avatar startup called Loom.ai . Purchasing a company that has focused singularly on creating more realistic human avatars is an interesting play for a gaming platform that has made such an impact by building experiences that tend to cast realism to the wayside. We covered the company’s $1.35 million seed round back in 2016. Since then, it has brought in additional seed funding, scoring $5.9 million in total capital raised. The startup’s investors include Y Combinator, Samsung Ventures, Anorak Ventures and Zach Coelius. Terms of the deal weren’t disclosed. Loom.ai was one in a long list of avatar companies to launch during the mid 2010’s that capitalized on computer vision advancements and aimed to build out a cross-game/cross-platform network of users that relied on their tech to create in-app avatars. This field of companies aimed to capitalize on opportunities in 3D that expanded beyond what companies like Snapchat had identified following its Bitmoji acquisition.
