European Union lawmakers are considering whether current rules aimed at limiting the practice of geoblocking across the bloc should be extended to cover access to streaming audio-visual content. Access to services like Netflix tends to be gated to individual EU Member States, meaning Europeans can be barred from accessing libraries of content offered elsewhere in the region. So if you’re trying to use your Netflix subscription to access the service after moving to another Member State, or want to access inventory offered by Netflix elsewhere in Europe, the answer is typically a big fat no, as we’ve reported before . This undermines the core concept of the EU’s Single Market (and the Digital Single Market — aka the frictionless e-commerce end-goal which rules such as those limiting geoblocking aim to deliver). The Commission is alive to ongoing issues around online access to audio-visual content. In a review of the two-year-old Geo-blocking Regulation published today, it says it will kick off discussions with the audio-visual sector on ways to improve consumer access to this type of copyrighted content across the bloc. It says the planned talks will feed its upcoming Media and Audiovisual Action Plan — which aims to help European market players scale up and reach new audiences. However, it’s not committing to any specific actions as yet. So whether the push yields anything more nuanced than another “no” remains to be seen. (The movie industry being a blocker to freer digital flows of content is, after all, not a new story .)
